### Getting started
- The base 
    1. ```addreq Django==1.11```
    2. ```djproj coffeeshop```
    3. ```djmig```
    4. ```djnewadmin```

### Interesting details  
- Note
    1. Part of the notes were taken inside the code.
    2. We could reduce lots of work if we're using ```> 2.0.0```, 
        - but umm.. I'll stay with ```1.11``` right now <small>( might refactorize later )</small>.
- About ```django-admin startproject PROJ_NAME```
    - ```BASEDIR```: the dir where ```manage.py``` lives <small>( can be **renamed** )</small>
    - ```PROJECT_DIR```: the subdir which includes the ```settings.py```
- Database drivers
    - The most common DBs
        - *PostgreSQL*: ```pip3 install psycopg2```
        - *MySQL*: ```pip3 install mysql-python``` <small>( huh? )</small>
    - The *fancy* ORMs
        - [Records: SQL for Humans](https://github.com/kennethreitz/records)
        - [PeeWee - a small, expressive ORM](https://github.com/coleifer/peewee)
        - [Pony Object Relational Mapper](https://github.com/ponyorm/pony) <small>( SQL-alike syntax )</small>

### Our first page
- Under **proj-coffeeshop/**
    - Edit *urls.py*
        - pattern: ```^$```, template: ```homepage.html```
    - Edit *templates/homepage.html*
        - Whatever
    - Edit *settings.py*
        - Add ```PROJECT_DIR = os.path.dirname(..)``` <small>( points to crt folder )</small>
        - Add ```TEMPLATES``` :: ```'DIRS': ['%s/templates/' % (PROJECT_DIR),]```

### The *app* 'about'
- A word
    - Since apps provide a modular way to group our proj's functionalities .
        - we don't have to do *everything* from **scratch**
        - better do a little research before you begin <small>( one step at a time, newbie! )</small>.
- A principle
    - Do naming aliases for the `views`, since there might be duplicates!
- Under **PROJECT_DIR/** <small>( where the ```settings.py``` lives )</small>
    - New :: *about/*
        - ```djapp about```
    - New :: *templates/about/*
        - ```touch "contact.html"```
    - Edit :: *settings.py*
        - ```'coffeeshop.about.apps.AboutConfig'```
    - Edit :: *views.py*
        - For now, there's only ```render(.. , 'about/contact.html')```
    - Edit :: *urls.py*
        - Do remember it's proj-level: ```url(r'^about/', about_views.contact)```

### The *app* 'admin/doc/'
- A word 
    1. Do make sure that put the ```^admin/doc/``` before the ```^admin/```.
    2. This *app* is actually kinda useful for me :)
- Under **BASE_DIR/** <small>( where the ```manage.py``` lives )</small>
    - Installing stuff by ```addreq docutils```
- Under **PROJECT_DIR/** <small>( where the ```settings.py``` lives )</small>
    - Edit :: *settings.py*
        - ```'django.contrib.admindocs.urls'```
    - Edit :: *urls.py*
        - ```url(r'^admin/doc/', include('django.contrib.admindocs.urls'))```
- Testing 
    - Here: [localhost:8000/admin/doc/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/doc/)
